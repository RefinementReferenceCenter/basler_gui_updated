# Recording with the Basler cameras under Windows

Using a little Python program by Niek Andresen (Department of Computer Vision & Remote Sensing, Technische Universit√§t Berlin, 10587 Berlin, Germany).

Updated version maintained by Davor Virag (Department of Pharmacology, University of Zagreb School of Medicine). Cleaned up a bit and added [BeDSy](https://github.com/davorvr/bedsy) functionality.

## Changes from the original version

### BeDSy

The **[BeDSy (Behaviour-recording Device Synchroniser)](https://github.com/davorvr/bedsy)** is a platform for hardware triggering and synchronisation of equipment for laboratory animal behavioural monitoring. Support was added by Davor during a [COST-TEATIME](https://www.cost-teatime.org/) Short-Term Scientific Mission to Lars Lewejohann's lab at the BfR to facilitate Paul Mieske's cool future experiments. To this end, thread management and timestamp logging were cleaned up a bit, but most of the code is unchanged.

The BeDSy can be toggled by a [flag in `recorder_Basler_gui.py`](https://github.com/RefinementReferenceCenter/basler_gui_updated/blob/8c0b6119406a25a4e0aa0e9a15b213ee44b4363e/recorder_Basler_gui.py#L22) (if set to `False`, the code is intended to act as Niek's original code). If enabled, instead of sending a "start recording" signal to the attached Basler cameras, it will configure the cameras to wait for a hardware trigger, and send a start signal to the BeDSy. The BeDSy automatically stops and restarts the signals, allowing the recording software to roll over to a new file. This prevents the files from growing too large and maintains synchronisation. This functionality is supported by this updated code.

## Required software

 * Python 3.11 - I recommend the [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/) distribution
 * Basler (links need updating)
   * Pylon camera software suite Windows: https://www.baslerweb.com/en/sales-support/downloads/software-downloads/#type=pylonsoftware;version=all;os=windows
   * PyPylon: https://github.com/basler/pypylon
   * Basler Video Recording Software: https://www.baslerweb.com/en/sales-support/downloads/software-downloads/basler-video-recording-software/
   * MPEG-4 extension to record with Basler software to MP4: https://www.baslerweb.com/de/vertrieb-support/downloads/downloads-software/pylon-zusatzpaket-fuer-mpeg4-windows/
   * Ffmpeg: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
   * OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
 * [PyUSB](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb)
   * Requires libusb win devel filter: https://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.6.0 (`libusb-win32-devel-filter-1.2.6.0.exe`)

## Setup

1.	Download this repo and unpack it
2.	Install the requirements above (you might want to use a Python virtual environment if you want to make sure your other Python programs will keep working. If you are not using Python much, it does not really matter and anything can be undone, so no risk.)
    1.	Pylon camera software suite:
        1.	Follow link above
        2.	Download newest Pylon camera software suite for Windows
        3.	Install it
    2.	Basler Video Recording Software and MPEG-4 extension:
        1.	Download links are above, install it
    3.	Ffmpeg:
        1.	Download link is above, download latest `release-essentials.zip`
        2.	Extract it to any location, where it doesn't bother you and can stay (e.g. `C:\Users\Niek\`)
        3.	Remember location of ffmpeg.exe (e.g. now `C:\Users\Niek\ffmpeg-4.4-essentials_build\bin\ffmpeg.exe`)
        4.	Open the file `recorder_Basler_gui.py` from Niek's code with a text editor (e.g. Notepad++)
            1.	There is a line, where the path to ffmpeg.exe should go. It looks like this:
            ```python
            ffmpeg_command = 'C:\\Users\\SCIoI Mouse Lab\\Downloads\\ffmpeg-20200831-4a11a6f-win64-static\\ffmpeg-20200831-4a11a6f-win64-static\\bin\\ffmpeg.exe' if platform.system() == 'Windows' else 'ffmpeg'
            ```
            2.	Replace the path by the correct one, but instead of / there have to be two backslashes (`\\`) everywhere.
            3.	Save the file
    4.	Libusb:
        1.	Download and install it
    5.	If Python is installed, the rest can be installed with `pip` e.g.:
        1.	Open command line (Windows Key, type `cmd`, click on (probably) first result)
        2.	Type `pip install pypylon`, hit enter
        3.	Do the same with `pip install pathlib`
        4.	Do the same with `pip install pyusb`
        5.	Do the same with `pip install opencv-python`

## Recording

 * Open the folder with the code and double click recorder_Basler_gui.py (two windows should open: a black command line and one with a text field and some buttons)
   * It might be convenient to make a shortcut to this file and put it on the Desktop
 * Type in (or paste) a path to a folder, where the videos should be put. The folder will be created if it doesn't exist. One can use `/` or `\` and the path usually starts with something like `C://`
 * Click the button or hit enter to start recording - do the same to stop
   * When recording a preview window for each Basler camera will appear. It shows what the cameras record, but not in the actual framerate. The framerate in the preview window is much lower than what is recorded.
 * When a recording is finished, the given folder should contain the video file(s)
 * The program can be exited with the quit button or the key `q` or the normal `x` at the top right
Further Notes
 * Usually it will not all work on first try, because this guide has mistakes and the computer is set up differently or whatever
   * Feel free to contact Davor or Niek for assistance
   * We can also make a phone or Zoom call
 * The code was written by Niek and is currently maintained by Davor. You can use and modify it freely under the GPLv3 license terms (publish your modifications). Bug reports (via message, e-mail or the [Issues](https://github.com/RefinementReferenceCenter/basler_gui_updated/issues) page) and [pull requests](https://github.com/RefinementReferenceCenter/basler_gui_updated/pulls) are welcome.
 * We would both be happy to help with the code and see it contribute to more research.

 * Reformatting to Markdown
 * Removed `pathlib` as a requirement as it's a part of Python's standard library (comes preinstalled with Python) since Python 3.4
 * Added a link to download `libusb-win32-devel-filter-1.2.6.0.exe` - it was originally included in a subdirectory
 * Redacted Niek's personal e-mail address
 
 My modifications to the code itself will be published in a forked repository.
